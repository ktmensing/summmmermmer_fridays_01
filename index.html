  <p>Fascism and Americanism are synonymous? Americanism is worse because it's stronger; they beat the fascists. What are Americans dedicated to? Luxury, having people do things for you. From his own experience? Yes. There are two Americas: a white America and a black America. The black man wants to be, first of all, a human being. White society is set up so they must oppress.<p/>
  <p>Fascism has been made obsolete by Americanism. America is the cancer on the world.</p>
